# What is it?

FRESH is a bad name for what is actually a FoREnsics SHell. Yes, I know, I
couldn't come up with something better and I'm sorry. And even if it comes in
form of a shell it is actually a whole framework for forensics analysis.

# But why?

I started Fresh as my dissertation project for the M.Sc. in Digital Investigations
and Computer Forensics at UCD (University College Dublin), in March 2016.
