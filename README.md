# What is it?

ForeWork as the name suggests is a Forensic Framework, whose main goal is to
help investigators to find relevant forensic evidence in the most efficient way
possible, depending on the computing resources at their disposal.

You can have a look at the early design at the [project draft](documentation/project_draft.pdf) and at the [literature review presentation](documentation/M1 - Literature review.pdf).

# But why?

I started ForeWork as my dissertation project for the M.Sc. in Digital Investigations
and Computer Forensics at UCD (University College Dublin), in March 2016.

# Installation

```bash
python setup.py install
```

# Running tests

Requires `pytest` and `pytest-cov`. Run:

```bash
py.test -v --cov=forework
```
