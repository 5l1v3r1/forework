# What is it?

FRESH is a bad name for what is actually a FoREnsics SHell. Yes, I know, I
couldn't come up with something better and I'm sorry. And even if it comes in
form of a shell it is actually a whole framework for forensics analysis.

# But why?

I wrote Fresh as my project for the M.Sc. in Digital Investigations and Computer
Forensics at UCD (University College Dublin).
